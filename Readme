# VineWoodFungiSegmentation

## Problem Statement
Modern agriculture is rapidly evolving, with robotics and AI playing a crucial role in optimizing crop maintenance and harvesting. However, a major challenge in vine cultivation is the early identification of fungal infections, which can significantly impact yield and quality.

Current automated agricultural systems primarily focus on harvesting but lack robust mechanisms to assess vine health effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose **VineWoodFungiSegmentation**, an AI-powered project that leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify vine wood images as **healthy** or **infected by fungi**.

By integrating this capability into agricultural robotics, we aim to enhance automated monitoring, reduce manual labor, and improve overall crop yield.

## Purpose
This project is a practical exercise in implementing CNNs for real-world agricultural applications. Through **VineWoodFungiSegmentation**, we aim to:
- Understand how CNNs process microscopic images for disease detection.
- Develop an AI-based classification model to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy vine wood.
- Explore potential integration into existing agricultural robotics, contributing to the future of precision farming.

## Dataset
We use the **UCI Dataset:**
**"An Eye on the Vine â€“ A Dataset for Fungi Segmentation in Microscopic Vine Wood Images."**
This dataset consists of microscopic vine wood images annotated for fungal infections. We welcome any suggestions and enhancements to improve our methodology and model accuracy.

---

## Objectives
- Train a CNN model to classify vines based on image data.
- Implement and deploy CNN-based image classification models.
- Improve agricultural automation by enabling AI-powered vine health assessment.

## Impact on Agricultural Robotics
Companies like **Abundant Robotics** and **Blue River Technologies** have pioneered AI-driven solutions for crop harvesting. However, these automated systems require extensive training data and validation mechanisms to ensure optimal performance.

Our proposed model will introduce a vine health assessment feature, enabling agricultural robots to not only harvest crops but also monitor crop health efficiently.

---

## Future Scope
- Higher accuracy in disease detection, reducing crop loss.
- Scalability for different crop types beyond vines.
- Integration with IoT-based monitoring systems for real-time disease tracking.
