# VineWoodFungiSegmentation
## Purpose
This project aims to determine whether a vine is healthy or affected by fungi using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a small activity designed to help us understand CNNs and their real-world applications.

## Objective
Based on image data, train a CNN model to classify vines as healthy or unhealthy.
Learn how to implement and deploy CNN-based image classification models.
