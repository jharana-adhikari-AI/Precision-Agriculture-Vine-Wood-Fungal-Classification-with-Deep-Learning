# VineWoodFungiSegmentation

## Purpose  
This project aims to determine whether a vine is healthy or affected by fungi using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a small activity designed to help us understand CNNs and their real-world applications.

## Objective  
- Train a CNN model to classify vines as healthy or unhealthy based on image data.  
- Learn how to implement and deploy CNN-based image classification models.
