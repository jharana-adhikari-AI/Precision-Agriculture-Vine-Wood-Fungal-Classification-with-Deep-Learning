VineWoodFungiSegmentation

Purpose  
This project aims to determine whether a vine is healthy or affected by fungi using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a small activity designed to help us understand CNNs and their real-world applications.

Data:
We will use a UCI Dataset[An eye on the vine - a dataset for fungi segmentation in microscopic vine wood images] for this practice. We would also like any suggestions and upgrades we can make further.

Objective  
- Train a CNN model to classify vines as healthy or unhealthy based on image data.  
- Learn how to implement and deploy CNN-based image classification models.

We plan on further increasing efficiency and providing aid for companies like Abundant Robotics, Blue River Technologies, and many others that use robotics and are trained with data for crop harvesting.

Automated machines can cut down on labour costs and provide efficient 24/7 care for crops, but they also require a lot of training data and any possible verification for vine health.

So, we aim to add that one feature to the robots and make them complete caretakers of the crops.

This is a cumulative work of Jharana Adhikari and Yasaswin Palukuri. Together we look forward a better working of the future farming industry.

We would be pleased to have you connect on LinkedIn and point out any clarifications if needed, and we are also open to going through any upgrades if suggested.
